\section{Introduction}
The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed traditional sensor systems into interconnected smart environments capable of real-time data sharing and analytics. Environmental monitoring is a key domain where IoT applications have proven effective in tracking temperature, humidity, and air quality parameters for smart homes, agriculture, and industrial safety. However, many existing systems are either cost-prohibitive or lack real-time cloud integration.

This project introduces an affordable and efficient ESP8266-based IoT Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) designed as a customizable platform that can be tailored to specific user requirements across diverse application domains. The device leverages the ESP8266MOD microcontroller for wireless connectivity and integrates multiple sensors, including the DHT11 for temperature and humidity, and the MQ-6 for gas detection. Sensor readings are displayed locally on an I2C LCD and transmitted over Wi-Fi to a Flask-based cloud backend, which stores the data in an SQLite database for real-time analytics and historical analysis.

A Streamlit-based cloud dashboard provides real-time visualization and statistical analysis of environmental parameters, enabling users to monitor trends and export data for further study. The system incorporates a comprehensive machine learning pipeline that processes historical sensor data to train models for anomaly detection and predictive analytics. ML models are deployed both in the cloud for comprehensive analysis and at the edge for real-time inference, enabling intelligent alert generation and proactive environmental management. The modular device architecture supports extensive customization, allowing users to configure sensor types, sampling rates, alert thresholds, ML model parameters, and data visualization parameters according to their specific needs. This custom model flexibility makes the device particularly well-suited for specialized applications such as research laboratories requiring precise environmental control, chemical reactors demanding real-time safety monitoring, and greenhouse facilities needing climate optimization. The device can be easily adapted with additional sensors, cloud services, or ML models with minimal changes, making it a versatile solution for diverse environmental monitoring scenarios where IoT, cloud computing, and machine learning integration are essential.

Key features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time data acquisition from the device and cloud synchronization at 10-second intervals.
    \item Local display of sensor readings and system status on the device LCD.
    \item RESTful API endpoints for secure data transfer between device and cloud backend.
    \item Interactive cloud dashboard with auto-refresh, CSV export, and Plotly-based charts.
    \item Machine learning pipeline for anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and intelligent alert generation.
    \item Cloud-based and edge inference capabilities for real-time ML predictions.
    \item Offline resilience through local device storage and cloud database backup.
    \item Custom model configuration allowing users to tailor device parameters, cloud analytics, and ML model training according to application-specific needs.
\end{itemize}

By addressing the limitations of existing solutions—such as lack of offline storage, poor cloud dashboard integration, and calibration drift—the proposed EMS offers a robust, cost-effective device with customizable cloud analytics platform for environmental monitoring. The device's modular design combined with cloud-based customization enables researchers and facility managers to configure monitoring parameters, sensor configurations, and alert thresholds specific to their operational requirements, whether for laboratory experiments, reactor safety monitoring, or greenhouse climate management. The custom model approach ensures that both the device hardware and cloud software can be adapted to meet diverse application needs.

\section{Literature Review}
Prior studies have demonstrated various IoT-based monitoring frameworks. In \cite{sensorcloud2019}, authors integrated low-cost microcontrollers with MQTT protocols for real-time air quality monitoring. Another work \cite{iotclimate2021} developed a temperature-humidity monitoring network using NodeMCU and Firebase, emphasizing reliability but lacking offline storage. Recent projects \cite{esp8266data2022, iotgas2023} incorporated gas sensors such as MQ-series for LPG detection, yet faced calibration drift and poor dashboard integration.

The need for customizable environmental monitoring systems has been extensively documented in research literature. Studies focusing on laboratory environments \cite{labmonitoring2020, precisionlab2021} have highlighted the importance of configurable sensor networks that can adapt to specific experimental requirements, including variable sampling rates, custom alert thresholds, and specialized data logging protocols. Research in chemical reactor monitoring \cite{reactorsafety2022, processmonitoring2023} emphasizes the critical need for real-time, customizable safety systems that can detect anomalies and trigger automated responses based on facility-specific parameters.

Greenhouse and controlled environment agriculture applications \cite{greenhouseiot2019, smartgreenhouse2021} have demonstrated the value of modular IoT systems that can be configured for different crop types, growth stages, and environmental optimization strategies. These studies show that customizable monitoring systems significantly improve resource efficiency and crop yields compared to fixed-configuration solutions. Additionally, research on industrial IoT platforms \cite{industrialiot2020, modularsensors2022} has established frameworks for building scalable, reconfigurable sensor networks that can evolve with changing operational requirements.

Other notable research includes the deployment of wireless sensor networks for large-scale environmental monitoring, where Zigbee and LoRaWAN protocols have been used to extend coverage and reduce power consumption \cite{zigbeewsn2018, lorawan2020}. Studies have also explored cloud-based analytics platforms, such as AWS IoT and Google Cloud, for scalable data processing and visualization \cite{awsiot2019}, though these often introduce higher costs and complexity. Some works have implemented machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and predictive analytics \cite{mlanomaly2022}, enhancing the utility of sensor data in smart city and industrial applications.

Despite these advancements, many existing solutions either lack real-time dashboard capabilities, suffer from limited offline data resilience, require expensive hardware, or lack the flexibility to be customized for specific application domains. The integration of RESTful APIs, local databases, and interactive dashboards remains limited in low-cost systems, and few platforms offer the modularity required for domain-specific customization in research laboratories, reactor facilities, and greenhouse operations.

Unlike these systems, the proposed EMS device employs a RESTful Flask cloud API for seamless communication between the ESP8266 device and a cloud-based SQLite database, paired with a Streamlit cloud dashboard that visualizes environmental trends using Plotly. The system uniquely integrates a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making. This hybrid IoT-cloud-ML architecture ensures both offline device resilience and dynamic cloud visualization, while ML models provide intelligent analysis and proactive alerts. More importantly, the device's modular design combined with cloud-based customization and ML model training enables extensive configuration flexibility, allowing users to configure sensor parameters, data acquisition intervals, alert thresholds, ML model parameters, and cloud visualization preferences according to their specific application needs—whether for laboratory experiments requiring precise environmental control with ML-based anomaly detection, reactor safety monitoring demanding real-time anomaly detection with predictive analytics, or greenhouse operations needing climate optimization strategies with ML-driven decision support. The custom model approach integrates device-level configurability with cloud-based analytics and machine learning intelligence, providing a comprehensive solution that adapts to user requirements.
\section{System Overview}
The system architecture comprises five main modules: sensor node, network layer, cloud backend, machine learning pipeline, and data dashboard with inference capabilities. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture}, the system integrates IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning to provide a comprehensive environmental monitoring solution.

\begin{figure*}[t]

\caption{System Architecture of the Customizable EMS Device-Cloud System}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Sensor Node}
The sensor node device is built around the ESP8266MOD microcontroller, which serves as the central controller for data acquisition and cloud transmission. This customizable device interfaces with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DHT11 Sensor:} Measures ambient temperature and relative humidity. Data is sampled every 10 seconds and validated for accuracy before cloud transmission.
    \item \textbf{MQ-6 Gas Sensor:} Detects the presence and concentration of gases such as LPG. The analog output is digitized and mapped to a percentage scale for easy interpretation and cloud analytics.
    \item \textbf{JHD162A LCD (I2C):} Displays sensor readings, Wi-Fi status, and cloud connectivity status. The display cycles through four screens: temperature-humidity, gas level with bar visualization, sensor status, and cloud connectivity.
    \item \textbf{Power Module (HW-131):} Ensures stable 5V supply from battery or USB source, protecting the microcontroller and sensors from voltage fluctuations, ensuring reliable device operation and cloud communication.
\end{itemize}
The ESP8266 device connects to Wi-Fi and transmits sensor data to the cloud backend via HTTP POST requests. The custom model allows users to configure transmission intervals, data formats, and cloud endpoints according to their needs. The device also handles error states, such as sensor disconnection or Wi-Fi loss, by displaying alerts on the LCD and buffering data locally until cloud connectivity is restored.

\subsection{Backend API}
The cloud backend is implemented using Flask and provides RESTful endpoints for secure data exchange between the device and cloud services:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{/api/sensor-data}: Accepts POST requests from the ESP8266 device, storing timestamped sensor readings in a cloud SQLite database.
    \item \texttt{/api/latest}: Returns the most recent device sensor data for cloud dashboard display.
    \item \texttt{/api/stats}: Provides aggregated statistics (min, max, average) for temperature, humidity, and gas levels over selectable time ranges, enabling custom cloud analytics.
    \item \texttt{/api/health}: Monitors device and cloud system status and uptime, enabling remote diagnostics.
\end{itemize}
The cloud backend ensures data integrity through input validation and error handling. It supports offline device resilience by caching data locally on the device and synchronizing with the cloud dashboard when connectivity resumes. The custom model allows users to configure cloud storage parameters, data retention policies, and analytics aggregation methods according to their application requirements.

\subsection{Data Dashboard}
The cloud dashboard is built with Streamlit and Plotly, offering an interactive web interface for real-time monitoring and analytics of device data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Live Charts:} Device sensor data including temperature, humidity, and gas concentration are visualized using dynamic line and bar charts, auto-refreshing every 5 seconds from the cloud database.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Analysis:} Users can view historical trends, compute averages, and identify anomalies over custom time intervals, with customizable cloud analytics parameters.
    \item \textbf{CSV Export:} Device sensor data stored in the cloud can be exported for offline analysis or reporting.
    \item \textbf{System Status:} Displays device connectivity, cloud synchronization status, last update time, and backend health indicators.
\end{itemize}
The cloud dashboard is designed for usability, supporting mobile and desktop browsers, and integrates ML-based predictions and anomaly alerts directly into the visualization interface. The custom model allows users to configure dashboard layouts, visualization types, ML alert thresholds, and predictive analytics parameters according to their specific monitoring needs.

\subsection{Machine Learning Pipeline}
The machine learning component forms a critical layer of the system, enabling intelligent analysis and prediction of environmental conditions. The ML pipeline consists of five stages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection:} Historical sensor data from the SQLite database is aggregated and preprocessed for ML model training. The system collects temperature, humidity, and gas concentration readings with timestamps, creating a comprehensive dataset for model development.
    
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing:} Raw sensor data undergoes feature engineering, normalization, and cleaning. Missing values are handled through interpolation, and outliers are identified using statistical methods. Temporal features such as time-of-day, day-of-week, and rolling averages are extracted to enhance model performance.
    
    \item \textbf{Model Training:} Multiple ML algorithms are evaluated, including Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, LSTM networks for time-series prediction, and Random Forest for classification tasks. Models are trained using cross-validation to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance for specific application domains.
    
    \item \textbf{Evaluation:} Trained models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Validation is performed on held-out test sets, and models achieving accuracy above 90\% are selected for deployment. The evaluation process also includes analysis of false positive and false negative rates to ensure practical utility.
    
    \item \textbf{Deployment:} Validated models are deployed in two modes: (1) \textbf{Cloud Inference} for comprehensive analysis using the full dataset and complex models, and (2) \textbf{Edge Inference} using lightweight models (TensorFlow Lite) for real-time predictions directly on the ESP8266 device. The deployment system includes model versioning, A/B testing capabilities, and automatic retraining triggers based on data drift detection.
\end{itemize}

The ML inference layer provides real-time anomaly detection and predictive alerts. Cloud inference processes historical trends and complex patterns, while edge inference enables immediate response to critical environmental changes. The alert system integrates predictions from both cloud and edge models, generating intelligent notifications when anomalies are detected or when predictive models forecast potential issues. This hybrid approach ensures both comprehensive analysis and rapid response times, making the system suitable for applications requiring both detailed analytics and real-time decision-making.

Overall, the modular device architecture combined with cloud services enables easy integration of new sensors, cloud analytics, and custom model features, making the system scalable and customizable for diverse environmental monitoring applications. Users can configure both the device and cloud components to meet specific requirements: research laboratories can set precise temperature and humidity ranges on the device with custom alert thresholds in the cloud dashboard; reactor facilities can integrate additional gas sensors on the device and configure safety protocols in the cloud; greenhouse operators can optimize device sensor placement and data collection intervals with cloud-based crop-specific monitoring analytics. This custom model flexibility ensures both the device and cloud system adapt to user needs rather than forcing users to adapt to fixed system constraints.

\section{Hardware Implementation}
The device hardware implementation centers on a compact, modular design for reliable sensor integration and cloud data transmission. This customizable device includes key components:
